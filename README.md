# Bayesian_inference

This repository contains jupyter notebooks demonstrating the use of Bayesian techniques for parameter estimation. 
Specifically, we demonstrate python implementations of the following methods: 
* Bayesian Linear Regression
* Grid Search 
* Gibbs Sampling 
* Metropolis Hastings 
* Laplace approximation

These methods are covered in three notebooks: 
1. Bayesian Model Fitting 
2. Gibbs Sampling 
3. Nonlinear Models

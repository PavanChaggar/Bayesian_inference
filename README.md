# Bayesian_inference

This repository contains jupyter notebooks demonstrating the use of Bayesian techniques for parameter estimation. 
Specifically, we demonstrate python implementations of the following methods: 
* Bayesian Linear Regression
* Grid Search 
* Gibbs Sampling 
* Metropolis Hastings 
* Laplace approximation
* Variational Inference

These methods are covered in four python notebooks: 
1. [Bayesian Model Fitting](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/PavanChaggar/Bayesian_inference/blob/master/python_tutorials/Bayesian_Model_Fitting.ipynb)
2. [Gibbs Sampling](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/PavanChaggar/Bayesian_inference/blob/master/python_tutorials/Gibbs_Sampling.ipynb)
3. [Nonlinear Models](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/PavanChaggar/Bayesian_inference/blob/master/python_tutorials/Nonlinear_models.ipynb)
4. [Variational Inference](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/PavanChaggar/Bayesian_inference/blob/master/python_tutorials/Variational_Inference.ipynb)

Progress is being made on Julia code and will continue to be updated.
